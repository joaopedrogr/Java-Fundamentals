# Java Fundamentals

## ðŸ“˜ Description
The Java Fundamentals repository is a comprehensive resource for developers looking to strengthen their foundation in Java programming. It focuses on core concepts that are crucial for writing efficient and readable Java code. Whether you are a beginner or returning to Java after some time, this repository is designed to be an accessible guide, with both theory and practical examples to reinforce learning.

Key concepts covered:

- Basic Syntax & Structure: The fundamental rules that govern the structure of a Java program.
- Primitive Data Types & Wrappers: Understanding the types of data Java handles and the use of wrapper classes for primitives.
- Operators & Expressions: Exploring how to use operators for calculations, comparisons, and logical operations.
- Input/Output Handling: Interacting with users via input and displaying output.
- String Manipulation: Working with and modifying text data.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
The project is organized in a way that allows for easy navigation, each section focusing on specific aspects of Java. Here is a breakdown of the file and folder structure:

### **Main Files**
#### Main.java
The entry point of the project. This file contains examples that demonstrate core Java concepts, showing how the theory is applied in code.


### **Fundamentals/** 
This folder contains essential examples and code snippets that demonstrate Java basics:
- **ConversaoTipoPrimitivoNumerico.java** - Demonstrates type conversion and type casting, essential for changing one data type into another (e.g., casting from int to double).
- **TipoString.java & TipoStringEquals.java** - TipoString.java showcases various string operations such as concatenation, length, and substring operations. TipoStringEquals.java explores how to compare strings for equality, focusing on the difference between using == and .equals() for string comparison.
- **Wrappers.java** - Introduces wrapper classes for primitive types, explaining how objects like Integer, Double, Boolean, etc., are used to wrap the basic types and provide additional methods.
- **TiposPrimitivos.java** - An overview of primitive data types in Java (e.g., int, double, char, boolean) and their default values, size, and use cases.


### **Operators/**
This folder highlights examples of Java operators and logical constructs:
- **Relacionais.java** - Examples of relational and comparison operators (<, >, ==, !=, <=, >=) and their usage in Java for comparing primitive types.
- **Ternario.java** - A detailed exploration of the ternary (conditional) operator, a shorthand for simple if-else conditions in Java. Example: condition ? value1 : value2.
- Additional examples focusing on other logical (e.g., &&, ||, !) and arithmetic operators (e.g., +, -, *, /, %).


### **Exercises/**
Contains practical exercises to solidify the understanding of Java fundamentals. These exercises are meant to challenge developers and provide hands-on experience with different topics.
Exercise Topics:
- Data Types: Create programs that handle different data types.
- Operators: Implement challenges requiring specific operators.
- String Manipulation: Write code that handles text processing tasks.
- Loops & Conditional Statements: Exercises on using for, while, if-else, and switch statements.
- Type Conversion: Write code that converts between various data types using casting and conversion methods.
